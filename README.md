entry.fulltext="So this blog is meant to track my progress as I begin learning how to program.Lame. Right? Well that's exactly what I thought when my brother suggested it to me. At first I was slightly hesitant to learn because it looked more difficult than learning Klingon, but so far I've been pleasently suprised with it. I just signed up for Code School and I'm about halfway through Try Ruby as of now, and I kind of like it. Before learning code it felt like I had limited use of my computer, but now I feel like I have a ton more control over what I want to do/see. Hopefully this excitement lasts throughout this journey."
